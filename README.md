# **PLURAL SIGHT BANK**
## A Banking App that provides users with full access to their transaction history over the years.

## *Features*

- CSV File Handling
- Console IO
- View all Transactions
- Add deposits and payments
- Generate reports that filter by Month, Year, Vendor, etc.

## *Three Screens To Navigate the Program*






## *Interesting Code*
One of the most interesting parts of the project was discovering how to use ANSI escape codes to add color to the console output. I never realized it was possible to make the terminal more vibrant, and it was exciting to bring a touch of creativity and personality into the code.
